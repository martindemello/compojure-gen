DEPENDS:
* Google app engine sdk: http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html
* appengine-clj: http://github.com/duelinmarkers/appengine-clj
* compojure: http://github.com/weavejester/compojure

Since this is just a skeleton generator, you don't need to have any of these actually installed, but the paths to each of the projects need to be filled into the config file.

USAGE:
* Edit app-engine/config.yml to point to the installation paths of the various components
* Run
   ruby /path/to/compojure-gen/appengine.rb <project name> [<display name>]
	 cd <project name>
	 ant devserver

and go to http://localhost:8080 to see the hello world app up and running.
